**How to use OMishi in OpenMusic**

*DO NOT RUN THE OPENMUSIC FOR THE FIRST 3 STEPS*

1.  Download the zip file from: [[HERE](https://github.com/yoshiakionishi/OMishi/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)]

2.  Once you download it, defrost the zip file. 

3.  Within the folder "OMishi-main," move the folder 
    "OMishi {version number}" to the OM libraries folder 
    (for Mac users, the default folder would be  
    /Users/{yourcomputername}/OM/Libraries
    You can also specify additional folder(s) from 
    OM Preferences later)

4.  Run OpenMusic. In Preferences => Libraries, under the 
    "Auto Load" list of libraries, OMishi should already appear
    if you moved the folder to the default OM libraries folder. 
    If "OMishi" is not checked, check it. Then click Apply. Exit
    the Preferences.

5.  You should now be able to use OMishi in your patches.

6.  For some functions, I have provided example patches. 
    Invoke, for example, the function "euclid-rhythm-binary", 
    click it, and type t to see the patch.
