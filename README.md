**How to use OMishi in OpenMusic**

*DO NOT RUN THE OPENMUSIC FOR THE FIRST 3 STEPS*

1.  Download the zip file from: [[HERE](https://github.com/yoshiakionishi/OMishi/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)]

2.  Once you download it, defrost the zip file. 

3.  Within the folder "OMishi-main," there are OMishi folders of multiple versions, as in: "OMishi {version number}". Move the folder with the most recent (highest) version to your OM libraries folder (for Mac users, the default folder would be   /Users/{yourcomputername}/OM/Libraries. You can also specify additional folder(s) from  OM Preferences later).
    
4.  Once you move the "OMishi {most recent version}" to your OM libraries folder, you may delete "OMishi-main" folder as well as the zip file you just downloaded in 1. and 2..

5.  Run OpenMusic. In Preferences => Libraries, under the "Auto Load" list of libraries, OMishi should already appear if you moved the folder to the default OM libraries folder. If "OMishi" is not checked, check it. Then click Apply. Exit the Preferences.

6.  You should now be able to use OMishi in your patches.

7.  For some functions, I have provided example patches. Invoke, for example, the function "euclid-rhythm-binary", click it, and type t to see the patch. More examples are being added in each new version...
